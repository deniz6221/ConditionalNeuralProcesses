# Conditional Neural Processes

This project uses CNMPs to train a model that predicts robots trajectories with a conditioned point.

### Training and Testing

The model can be trained with the train() function and it can be tested with the test() function. Both functions are in main.ipynb file.

### Results

The loss plot can be found in loss.png and the bar plot can be found in BarPlot.png
